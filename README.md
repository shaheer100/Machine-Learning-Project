# Predicting Olympic Medal Counts using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the number of medals a country will achieve in the Olympics using machine learning techniques. Following a comprehensive 7-step process, the aim is to build an effective predictive model that provides valuable insights into a country's performance.

## Steps to Build the Project

### `1. Hypothesis`

The hypothesis revolves around predicting Olympic medal counts based on various factors. The goal is to analyze data related to athlete participation, previous medal achievements, and other pertinent features to develop a reliable model for medal count prediction.

### `2. Finding the Data`

The dataset used is obtained from the Summer Olympics, comprising over 2000 rows. Each row corresponds to a specific country's participation in a given Olympic year. The dataset includes essential columns such as:

- `Country`: The participating country
- `Year`: The year of the Olympics
- `Athletes`: Number of athletes representing the country
- `Previous Medals`: Medals won by the country in the previous year
- `Medals`: The target variable - the number of medals won in the current Olympics

### `3. Reshaping the Data`

To facilitate effective prediction, the data is reshaped so that each row contains the necessary information for a single-year medal count prediction. Relevant features are extracted and the data is structured to create distinct prediction scenarios.

### `4. Clean the Data`

Data cleanliness is crucial. Missing values, particularly in cases where teams didn't participate in the previous year, are addressed. Data cleaning involves techniques such as imputation and column elimination to ensure data consistency and quality.

### `5. Finding an Error Metric`

The mean absolute error (MAE) is employed as the chosen error metric to gauge the model's performance. MAE provides a straightforward assessment of prediction accuracy by measuring the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.

### `6. Split the Data`

The dataset is divided into two subsets: the training set and the test set. The training set is utilized to train the machine learning algorithm, while the test set evaluates the model's capability to make accurate predictions on unseen data.

### `7. Train a Model`

For this project, a linear regression model is employed. The linear regression equation takes the form: `Medals = a1 * Athletes + a2 * Previous_Medals + b`, where `a1`, `a2`, and `b` are learned coefficients during the training phase.

## Conclusion

By systematically following the 7-step process and leveraging machine learning methodologies, the aim is to create an effective predictive model capable of estimating a country's Olympic medal count. This project exemplifies the application of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a real-world context.
